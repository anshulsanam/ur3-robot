Our goal is to make a system of robots that can collaborate and sort objects from a conveyor belt.

#### Project Update 2
Our robot executes a 360º spin movement every time an object passes through a gate counter.

#### Project Update 3
Applied forward kinematics to VREP simulation to find the position of the end effector given the joint angle positions. 

Referred to the official documentation utilized the function “simxGetObjectPosition,” from the Remote API for python.

Updated maximum angular joint velocity

Switched to a UR10 Robot instead of UR3

Implemented Gripper and learned how to use it to pick up items
